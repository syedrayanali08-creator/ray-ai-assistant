# Architecture Decision Records

An ADR records one significant technical decision: the context that forced it, the
choice made, the alternatives rejected, and the consequences accepted.

`/docs` is the source of truth for *what* Ray is. The ADRs are the source of truth
for *how* Ray is built and *why*. When a decision changes, add a new ADR that
supersedes the old one rather than editing history.

## Format

Every ADR uses the same sections: Status, Context, Decision, Alternatives
considered, Consequences.

Status is one of `Accepted`, `Superseded by ADR-XXXX`, or `Proposed`.
