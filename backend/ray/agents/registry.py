"""The agent registry.

Agents are code, not database rows (ADR-0005). This module is the single source of
truth for which agents exist and what each is allowed to touch; the database only
records whether the user has disabled one and what it did.

Phase 4 gives these entries real implementations. Declaring them now keeps the
Executive Agent's routing table and the dashboard honest in the meantime.
